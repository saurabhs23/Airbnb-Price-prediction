# Airbnb-Price-prediction

## Problem Setting:
Airbnb was born in 2007 when two Hosts welcomed three guests to their San Francisco home, and
has since grown to over 4 million Hosts who have welcomed more than 1 billion guest arrivals in
almost every country across the globe. Every day, Hosts offer unique stays and experiences that
make it possible for guests to connect with communities in a more authentic way.Airbnb is an online
marketplace which focuses on providing vacation experiences, weekend outings and homestays by
acting as a liaison between customers and hosts interested in renting their stays.The company seeks
to increase its portfolio and hence wants to accurately forecast the sales price of properties in order
to fetch more customers and build healthier relationships with the hosts. We will help the company by
looking into the listings present in New York city to provide them insights about the features that
affect the prices as well as provide predictive modeling for prices of their listings present all around
the city. Airbnb has different types of prices for different neighborhoods and room-types. So, to
predict the prices of Airbnb is a challenging task.

## Problem Definition:
Several studies have indicated that landlords are taking their houses off the long-term rental market
and renting them out on short-term housing platforms like Airbnb because the rates are greater. A
study published in July 2017 indicated that a 10% rise in Airbnb listings in a specific neighborhood
corresponded to a 0.42% increase in rents and a 0.76% increase in house prices. Landlords have
also been accused of illegally evicting tenants to convert houses into higher-rent Airbnb listings. The
problem at hand is to get the pricing of properties right due to the competition that is present
especially in the big metropolitan cities such as New York. The competitive pricing can be a make or
break when considering customer conversions and hence it is of utmost importance that the
organization gets an apt pricing for the properties. As, price of Airbnb depends upon many categories
like room_type, neighborhood etc. the price cannot be predicted easily. There are many duplicates
and many outliers in this dataset.
