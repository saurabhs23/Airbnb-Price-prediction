# Airbnb-Price-prediction

## Problem Setting:
Airbnb was born in 2007 when two Hosts welcomed three guests to their San Francisco home, and
has since grown to over 4 million Hosts who have welcomed more than 1 billion guest arrivals in
almost every country across the globe. Every day, Hosts offer unique stays and experiences that
make it possible for guests to connect with communities in a more authentic way.Airbnb is an online
marketplace which focuses on providing vacation experiences, weekend outings and homestays by
acting as a liaison between customers and hosts interested in renting their stays.The company seeks
to increase its portfolio and hence wants to accurately forecast the sales price of properties in order
to fetch more customers and build healthier relationships with the hosts. We will help the company by
looking into the listings present in New York city to provide them insights about the features that
affect the prices as well as provide predictive modeling for prices of their listings present all around
the city. Airbnb has different types of prices for different neighborhoods and room-types. So, to
predict the prices of Airbnb is a challenging task.
